# Contributing Guide: Electricity Sector Lexicon

Want to help improve the 
[Electricity Sector Lexicon](https://grahamlea.github.io/Electricity-Sector-Lexicon/)?
Great!
Here's the deal...


## Copyright & Licensing

For efficiency reasons, the copyright in any contributions is transferred to the project author,
[Graham Lea](https://github.com/GrahamLea).

Practically, the whole project is Creative Commons BY-NC-SA (see [LICENSE.md](LICENSE.md)),
so the content is free to use and share under the same license in non-commercial contexts 
with attribution.


## What to Contribute

There are already things we'd like to add to the project but haven't got around to that are 
described in the project's
[Issues](https://github.com/GrahamLea/Electricity-Sector-Lexicon/issues)
tab, so that's a good place to look if you're wanting ideas.

But your ideas are probably good, too!
A contribution from a motivated individual about something they think is a priority is 
better than no contribution at all.


## Ask First

To save you time in creating a submission that isn't actually something that's wanted, 
reach out first via by creating an 
[issue](https://github.com/GrahamLea/Electricity-Sector-Lexicon/issues) 
briefly describing what you'd like to contribute.


## How to Write

In creating content for the lexicon, please consider the following areas:


### Audience

The intended audience of the content is technically-minded adult professionals who are 
new to the electricity sector.

Content doesn't need to be understood by a primary school student, 
but also shouldn't require an engineering background to comprehend.
It assumes close to no knowledge of electrical engineering or physics.

It's expected that some definitions will only be able to be understood if other terms are
also understood. Related terms should be linked where that is the case.


### Aim

The chief aim of the project is to make it easy for professionals who've recently joined 
the electricity sector to quickly upskill on a vast array of relevant terminology used
in the industry.

The content will likely also be useful to many other people, 
but adjusting the content to accommodate other audiences is not a goal.


### Depth

The pitch for the content depth is somewhere between a dictionary and an encyclopedia.
We don't just want a single sentence that explains the terms but leaves the concepts and 
context a mystery.
We also don't want many paragraphs explaining all possible details that anyone might 
want to know about the topic.
Encyclopedias and text books already exist to serve that need. 

Looking back to the Audience and the Aim, the right depth for the content will be enough
for someone who's looking to understand the term for the first time as part of their job 
to get their head around it quickly and get to work using it.

To an extent, the depth in a definition should be guided by the importance of the topic.
'Energy' gets a really long description because it's a foundational concept that most in
the electricity should understand in some depth.
'United Energy' gets one sentence, because everything someone should need to know about it
from this guide fits in one sentence.
Someone needing to know more about United Energy should quickly look somewhere else.


### Style

The style of writing should be guided by these principles:
* Short sentences over long ones
* Plain language over technical
* Casual tone over formal
* Physical descriptions over analogy


### Organisation

There are currently four dimensions of organisation:
* Categories: These are hierarchical
* Regions: Labels highlighting a term chiefly relevant only to the specified geography
* 'Used Very Frequently': A binary flag that suggests a term is relatively important
* Order: Categories and terms are currently displayed in the order they are included 
  hierarchically via `index.json5`. 


### Links

Heavy inter-linking between terms is highly encouraged.

Linking to external sources, both text and video, is also encouraged.
External links should generally be to other education-focused resources.

For consistency, we prioritise linking to the following excellent sources where they have relevant, good quality content:
* [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page)
* [The Engineering Mindset](https://www.youtube.com/c/Theengineeringmindset)
* [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org)
* Official websites for referenced organisations
