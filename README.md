This project is an attempt to make a relatively comprehensive and
accessible lexicon of electricity sector knowledge.

The intended audience of the content is technically-minded adults who
are new to the electricity sector.

The lexicon is presented as a stateless web page that makes searching
for relevant content easier.


## Project Organisation

The data that forms the lexicon is stored in the 
[JSON5](https://json5.org/) format under [data/](data).

The lexicon GUI is in the [gui/](gui) folder and is a Vue app 
designed around the JSON data.
