This project is an attempt to make a relatively comprehensive and
accessible field guide of electricity sector knowledge.

The intended audience of the content is technically-minded adult
professionals who are new to the electricity sector.

The guide is presented as a stateless web page that makes searching
for relevant content easier.


## Project Organisation

The data that forms the guide is stored in the 
[JSON5](https://json5.org/) format under [docs/data/](docs/data).

The guide's GUI is in the [docs/](docs) folder and is a Vue 3 app 
designed around the JSON data.
