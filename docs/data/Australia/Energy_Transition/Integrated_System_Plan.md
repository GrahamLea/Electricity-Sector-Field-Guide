# Integrated System Plan

## Abbreviations
- ISP


## Summary

[Australian Energy Market Operators]â€™s roadmap for the transition of the
[National Electricity Market] (NEM) power system over the next several decades.


## More

AEMO says the ISP is "a clear plan for essential infrastructure that will meet future energy needs."
It includes forecasts about coal plant closures and future energy [consumption] and [peak capacity],
and recommendations for the future [generation] mix, [storage], [distributed energy resources] (DER)
(including [CER]), and [transmission network] investments,
with a view to guide Australia's [electricity network] transition to [net zero] by 2050.
It assesses various scenarios and options with the aim of identifying the lowest-cost path to net zero,
which it calls the Optimal Development Path (ODP).

The ISP is rewritten every two years in consultation with industry, government, and energy consumers.
As part of the 2024 edition, AEMO consulted with over 2,100 stakeholders and considered 220 submissions.
The details of what must be included in the plan are set out in the [AEMC]'s National Electricity Rules.

The ISP estimates the cost of building the recommended generation, storage, and transmission.
The 2024 edition estimated an upfront present value capital cost of AUD $142 billion to 2050.
$16 billion of annualised transmission investment is forecast to return net market benefits of
$18.5 billion in avoided costs to consumers, and an additional $3.3 billion in emission reductions.
The ISP doesn't include the cost of CER investments or [distribution network] upgrades.
