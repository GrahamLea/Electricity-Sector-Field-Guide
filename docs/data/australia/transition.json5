        summary:
        "[Australian Energy Market Operators]â€™s roadmap for the transition of the \
        [National Electricity Market] (NEM) power system over the next several decades.",
        more:
        "AEMO says the ISP is \"a clear plan for essential infrastructure that will meet future energy needs.\" \
         It includes forecasts about coal plant closures and future energy [consumption] and [peak capacity], \
         and recommendations for the future [generation] mix, [storage], [distributed energy resources] (DER) \
         (including [CER]), and [transmission network] investments, \
         with a view to guide Australia's [electricity network] transition to [net zero] by 2050. \
         It assesses various scenarios and options with the aim of identifying the lowest-cost path to net zero, \
         which it calls the Optimal Development Path (ODP). \
         \n\
         The ISP is rewritten every two years in consultation with industry, government, and energy consumers. \
         As part of the 2024 edition, AEMO consulted with over 2,100 stakeholders and considered 220 submissions. \
         The details of what must be included in the plan are set out in the [AEMC]'s National Electricity Rules. \
         \n\
         The ISP estimates the cost of building the recommended generation, storage, and transmission. \
         The 2024 edition estimated an upfront present value capital cost of AUD $142 billion to 2050. \
         $16 billion of annualised transmission investment is forecast to return net market benefits of \
         $18.5 billion in avoided costs to consumers, and an additional $3.3 billion in emission reductions. \
         The ISP doesn't include the cost of CER investments or [distribution network] upgrades. "
