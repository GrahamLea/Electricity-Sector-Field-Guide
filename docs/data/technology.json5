        summary:
        "Hardware and software that works together to manage the energy flows in a residential property, \
        typically optimising to minimise costs or maximise earnings.",
        more:
        "The need for a HEMS arises from the installation of multiple [DER] on a site: [solar PV], [home batteries], \
         [EV chargers], and other [controllable load]s. \
         While each of these devices may be \"smart\" in their own right, being able to monitor some conditions on \
         the site and respond accordingly, as more devices are added that aren't aware of each other, the need for a \
         centralised system to orchestrate the overall system behaviour becomes more necessary. \
         \n\
         Home Energy Management Systems may be able to provide a variety of different solutions depending on the \
         needs of the property, such as cost optimisation, [peak shaving], [energy arbitrage], [export limiting], \
         and [solar curtailment]. \
         \n\
         Energy Management System (EMS) is a rather generic term and may refer to a technology system which manages \
         the energy at a single property, like a HEMS, or a similar system for commercial or industrial applications, \
         or even across a very large system like a distribution grid. \
         Energy Management System may also used to refer to a long-term business process for cataloging and \
         evolving an organisation's energy usage and assets. \
         EMS can also refer to Energy Management Software.",
