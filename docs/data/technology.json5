        "The need for a HEMS arises from the installation of multiple [DER] on a site: [solar PV], [home batteries], \
         [EV chargers], and other [controllable load]s. \
         While each of these devices may be \"smart\" in their own right, being able to monitor some conditions on \
         the site and respond accordingly, as more devices are added that aren't aware of each other, the need for a \
         centralised system to orchestrate the overall system behaviour becomes more necessary. \
