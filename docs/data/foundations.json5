        "By way of analogy, measuring current in an electrical system is like measuring the volume of water passing a \
        point per second in a water system. \
        In electrical systems, current is most commonly electrons flowing through metals, known as an electron current. \
        In semiconductors, such as those used to create [transistors] and [solar PV], the charged particles forming \
        the current may include electrons, electron holes, and ions. \n\
        Current may exist in a system as [direct current], moving in one direction, or [alternating current], moving \
        back and forth. \
        By historical convention, the \"direction of current\" is the direction that positive charges would be flowing \
        if they were present, which is counter to the direction electrons will be flowing in electrical circuits, as \
        they are negatively charged. \n\
        Conductors and devices in an electrical system will have a maximum current they’re capable of withstanding. \
        [Resistors] can be used to reduce the current in a circuit. \
        [Fuses] and [circuit breakers] protect against excessive current by breaking the circuit. \n\
        The flow of electric current creates a magnetic field. When a current varies over time, it creates an \
        electromagnetic wave."

        Simply, the potential for [energy] transfer within a system. \
        Technically, the difference in electrical potential between two points, per unit of charge. \
        Conventionally represented by the symbol <i style='font-family: serif;'>V</i> or sometimes \
         <i style='font-family: serif;'>ΔV</i>. Measured in [Volts], abbreviated as “V”. \

        Voltage is defined as [energy] (in joules) per unit charge (coulomb). \
        It is the amount of potential work that could be performed by each charged particle. \
        Note this means the energy in a circuit is not determined solely by the [current] (the amount of charged \
        particles moving), but also by the voltage applied. \n\
        \
        Voltage is often explained in terms of analogy, for example a bowling ball lifted off the ground, which has \
        potential energy. \
        The potential energy of the bowling ball is a function of its mass and the height of the ball. \
        Lifting the ball higher increases the potential \"work\" (or damage!) it can do when dropped, even though \
        its mass hasn't changed. \
        In the same way, voltage can be thought of as the \"height\" of charged particles, with those at a higher \
        voltage having more potential to do work when they move from a point of high potential a lower one. \n\
        \
        Voltage can be present independent of an electric circuit or a current. \
        A battery that is not in a circuit still has a voltage across its two ends. \
        This is like a dam with its pipes closed: there is still a lot of potential for energy transfer despite there \
        being no water moving. \n\
        \
        While sometimes referred to as the \"pushing force\", voltage is not really a force. \
        It is representative of the force that can be created. \
        Technically, it is not voltage that pushes energy around a circuit, but the electric field induced by applying \
        the voltage to a conductor. \
