        "By way of analogy, measuring current in an electrical system is like measuring the volume of water passing a \
        point per second in a water system. \
        In electrical systems, current is most commonly electrons flowing through metals, known as an electron current. \
        In semiconductors, such as those used to create [transistors] and [solar PV], the charged particles forming \
        the current may include electrons, electron holes, and ions. \n\
        Current may exist in a system as [direct current], moving in one direction, or [alternating current], moving \
        back and forth. \
        By historical convention, the \"direction of current\" is the direction that positive charges would be flowing \
        if they were present, which is counter to the direction electrons will be flowing in electrical circuits, as \
        they are negatively charged. \n\
        Conductors and devices in an electrical system will have a maximum current they’re capable of withstanding. \
        [Resistors] can be used to reduce the current in a circuit. \
        [Fuses] and [circuit breakers] protect against excessive current by breaking the circuit. \n\
        The flow of electric current creates a magnetic field. When a current varies over time, it creates an \
        electromagnetic wave."

        "AC is the form of current produced by turbine generators such as in coal-fired and gas-fired power plants, \

        The sinusoidal waveform of many AC sources occurs as a result of the current being generated from the rotation \
        of a magnetic field that induces a current in a nearby conductor first in one direction and then the other.\n\
        Alternating current is the dominant method of electricity [transmission] and [distribution], due in large part \
        to the ability to easily step the voltage up and down using transformers to increase efficiency. \

        "A quantitative measure of the ability for something to perform \"work\", with work being the \

        Measured in joules ('J') or, more commonly in relation to electricity, [kilowatt-hours] (kWh). \

        "Energy in electricity is literally the same \"energy\" in fundamental physics. \
        Energy will most commonly be used in electricity when discussing either \
        the energy used or generated by something over some time period \
        (e.g. a household using an average of 30kWh per day, or a power plant producing 14 TWh per year) or \
        the storage capacity of some energy asset (e.g. a 10kWh battery). \n\
        \
        Energy and [power] are separate but related concepts. \
        Energy is a measure of a quantity, while power is the rate at which energy is moving or performing work. \
        (Notice that the unit of power, the watt, is defined as joules per second, i.e. energy/time.) \
        Using kWh as a unit for energy frames it in terms of the amount of power it can deliver for a period of time: \
        one kilowatt of power for 1 hour. (1kWh = 3600kJ) \n\
        \
        Electrical energy is only one of many forms of energy relevant to the electricity industry. \
        Fossil-fueled power plants transfer chemical energy into heat energy, then into rotational kinetic energy, \
        then into electrical energy.\
        Hydroelectric plants convert gravitational potential energy into kinetic then electrical energy, \
        while [pumped hydro] reverses the same process. \
        Discharging a battery converts chemical energy into electrical energy, and charging one converts back into \
        chemical energy. \n\
        \
        The Law of Conservation of Energy tells us energy is never created or used, but only transferred or transformed. \
        We may say a light bulb \"used\" or \"consumed\" 1kWh of energy, but actually it transformed 1kWh of energy \
        into other forms: mostly light and heat. \
        Many processes related to electricity result in energy \"losses\", which means some energy has resulted in \
        unintended work and so is unavailable for the intended work. \
        Heat escaping from a system, whether it was generated intentionally or not, is a common source of energy loss. \n\
        \
        The energy in an electrical system is not simply a function of the number of electrons moving, i.e. the current. \
        The same current will deliver varying amounts of energy depending on the [voltage]. \
        Voltage is actually defined in terms of how it relates energy and current, being the amount of potential work \
        that could be performed by each charged particle. \n\
        \
        If the power of a component is known, its energy transfer can be calculated by multiplying the power by the \
        time. For example, an air conditioner using 4kW of power for half an hour uses 2kWh of energy. \n\
        \
        \"Work\", being simply the transfer of energy (irrespective of time), is also measured using \
        joules or watt-hours. \n\
        \
        Energy is typically the main component of how an electricity company will meter and charge their customers. \
        Sometimes a customer may incur a charge based on their maximum power demand on the grid connection during \
        some time window. \

        Voltage is defined as [energy] (in joules) per unit charge (coulomb). \
        It is the amount of potential work that could be performed by each charged particle. \
        Note this means the energy in a circuit is not determined solely by the [current] (the amount of charged \
        particles moving), but also by the voltage applied. \n\
        \
        Voltage is often explained in terms of analogy, for example a bowling ball lifted off the ground, which has \
        potential energy. \
        The potential energy of the bowling ball is a function of its mass and the height of the ball. \
        Lifting the ball higher increases the potential \"work\" (or damage!) it can do when dropped, even though \
        its mass hasn't changed. \
        In the same way, voltage can be thought of as the \"height\" of charged particles, with those at a higher \
        voltage having more potential to do work when they move from a point of high potential a lower one. \n\
        \
        Voltage can be present independent of an electric circuit or a current. \
        A battery that is not in a circuit still has a voltage across its two ends. \
        This is like a dam with its pipes closed: there is still a lot of potential for energy transfer despite there \
        being no water moving. \n\
        \
        While sometimes referred to as the \"pushing force\", voltage is not really a force. \
        It is representative of the force that can be created. \
        Technically, it is not voltage that pushes energy around a circuit, but the electric field induced by applying \
        the voltage to a conductor. \
