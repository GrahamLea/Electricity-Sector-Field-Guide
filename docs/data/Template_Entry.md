## Summary

Describes the entry's term as briefly as possible using short, semiformal sentences.
May draw attention to (and link to) other terms that are very closely related.
Always one paragraph at most.


## More

Where it would be valuable to someone new to the industry, this section can be used to
expound the term in more detail.
How much detail is relevant depends on the complexity of the term being covered and its 
importance in the electricity sector.

Multiple paragraphs can be used in this section, separated by an empty line.
A more conversational tone is generally used in this section, as if you were 
explaining the details in person to an interested and intelligent adult.

Lots of links to other relevant terms in the guide is encouraged, 
but only the first mention of a term within the Entry should be linked.
Links to terms that should probably be in the guide but are not yet can also be included.

Please read the project's `CONTRIBUTING.md` for other important authoring instructions.
