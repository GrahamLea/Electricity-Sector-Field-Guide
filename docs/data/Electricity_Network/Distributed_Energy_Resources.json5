    summary: "Electrical hardware that provides energy production, consumption, or storage at a low magnitude          compared to traditional grid-scale technology like large power plants.          The resources are \"distributed\" because they exist across a wide area within a network, in contrast to larger          resources which are in a small number of locations.",
    more: "The category of DER can contain a wide variety and scale of devices.          At the lower end of the DER spectrum are [Consumer Energy Resources] (CER).          DER also includes non-consumer-scale technologies that have high cardinality and are geographically distributed,          such as small-scale [Commercial & Industrial] solar or wind farms, [Community Batteries],          small hydropower stations or [pumped hydro].          Some uses of the term DER may also include [controllable loads] or [smart devices].          In some contexts, DER may be used to only refer to CER, not larger distributed resources.",
