# Virtual Power Plant
#UsedVeryFrequently

## Abbreviations
- VPP


## Summary

A group of [Distributed Energy Resources] that can be controlled collectively and remotely to increase or
decrease electricity supply or demand in a network, or to provide other [ancillary services].


## More

The "power plant" designation recognises that, together, the grouped resources can have a high-magnitude
effect on a network equivalent to a traditional grid-scale [power plant], while the "virtual" moniker recognises
that the "plant" does not exist in a concentrated physical form like a typical station, but only by virtue of
the resources being controlled as a group.
