  definition: {
    summary: "A group of [Distributed Energy Resources] that can be controlled collectively and remotely to increase or         decrease electricity supply or demand in a network, or to provide other [ancillary services].",
    more: "The \"power plant\" designation recognises that, together, the grouped resources can have a high-magnitude         effect on a network equivalent to a traditional grid-scale [power plant], while the \"virtual\" moniker recognises         that the \"plant\" does not exist in a concentrated physical form like a typical station, but only by virtue of         the resources being controlled as a group.",
