# Distributed Energy Resources
#UsedVeryFrequently

## Synonyms
- Distributed Energy
- Decentralised Energy
- Distributed Generation
- Embedded Generation

## Abbreviations
- DER


## Summary

Electrical hardware that provides energy production, consumption, or storage at a low magnitude
compared to traditional grid-scale technology like large power plants.
The resources are "distributed" because they exist across a wide area within a network, in contrast to larger
resources which are in a small number of locations.


## More

The category of DER can contain a wide variety and scale of devices.
At the lower end of the DER spectrum are [Consumer Energy Resources] (CER).
DER also includes non-consumer-scale technologies that have high cardinality and are geographically distributed,
such as small-scale [Commercial & Industrial] solar or wind farms, [Community Batteries],
small hydropower stations or [pumped hydro].
Some uses of the term DER may also include [controllable loads] or [smart devices].
In some contexts, DER may be used to only refer to CER, not larger distributed resources.
