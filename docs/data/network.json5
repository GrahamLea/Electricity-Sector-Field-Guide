        "A conservative definition of \"the grid\" could include just the wires and associated equipment between \
         (but not including) [power station]s and consumers, i.e. the [transmission network]s and [distribution network]s. \
         A broader definition might also include power generation equipment and large-scale storage, and potentially \
         even consumers of power, though most people would probably not consider their house as part of the grid. \
         Most commonly \"the grid\" is used to refer to the physical hardware used to convey power, though it may also \
         be intended to include non-hardware technology, and also the organisations that own and operate the commercial \
         assets. \
         \n\
         A grid, without qualification, typically refers to a wide-area synchronous grid, a network \
         covering a relatively large geographic area (e.g. a small nation, or a large area of a larger nation), \
         integrating a significant number of power generators (all synchronised to a common voltage and frequency), and \
         potentially multiple or many distribution networks. \
         There are also microgrids and super grids. \
         Microgrids cover a single, relatively small geographic region, and may be standalone, or may be able to be \
         connected to and disconnected from a wide-area synchronous grid, a.k.a. \"islandable\". \
         Super grids cover very large geographic regions, typically continental and/or multinational, by connecting \
         multiple synchronous grids, often using asynchronous high-voltage [DC] interconnections."
