    summary: "[Energy Management System] managing the energy flows in a residential property,         typically optimising to minimise costs, maximise earnings, and comply with distributor .",
    more: "The need for a HEMS arises from the installation of multiple [DER] on a site: [solar PV], [home batteries],          [EV chargers], and other [controllable load]s.          While each of these devices may be \"smart\" in their own right, being able to monitor some conditions on          the site and respond accordingly, as more devices are added that aren't aware of each other, the need for a          centralised system to orchestrate the overall system behaviour becomes more necessary.          \n         See [EMS] for a list of benefits that a HEMS can provide.",
