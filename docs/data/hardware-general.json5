        summary:
        "Electrical component which transfers [AC] electrical energy from one circuit to another without an electrical \
         connection between the two, widely used to increase and decrease voltage.",

        "A typical transformer works by having two coils of wire wrapped around a shared magnetic core. \
         As alternating current oscillates in one coil (the \"primary winding\"), this induces a change in the magnetic \
         field in the shared core, which in turn induces an alternating current in the other coil (\"secondary winding\"). \
         This makes the [power] in one circuit (most of it, anyway) available in the other circuit. \
         \n\
         In [transmission network]s and [distribution network]s, transformers are used extensively to change [voltage]. \
         This is most typically first increasing it (\"step-up\" transformer) near a generator in order to reduce the \
         [current], which reduces [resistance] losses in long-distance transmission, then decreasing it \
         (\"step-down\" transformer) to the voltages typically supplied to consumers.",
