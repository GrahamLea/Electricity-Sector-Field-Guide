# Transformer
#UsedVeryFrequently


## Summary

Electrical component which transfers [AC] electrical energy from one circuit to another without an electrical
connection between the two. Widely used to increase and decrease voltage.


## More

A typical transformer works by having two coils of wire wrapped around a shared magnetic core.
As alternating current oscillates in one coil (the "primary winding"), this induces a change in the magnetic
field in the shared core, which in turn induces an alternating current in the other coil ("secondary winding").
This makes the [power] in one circuit (most of it, anyway) available in the other circuit.

In [transmission network]s and [distribution network]s, transformers are used extensively to change [voltage].
This is most typically first increasing it (with a "step-up" transformer) near a generator in order to reduce the
[current], which has the effect of reducing [resistance] losses in long-distance transmission, then decreasing it
("step-down" transformer) to the voltages typically supplied to consumers.
