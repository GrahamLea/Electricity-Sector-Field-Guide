    summary: "A form of [current] where charged particles flow in both directions (in contrast to [direct current]),         with both voltage and current oscillating many times a second, typically in a sine-wave pattern.",
    more: "AC is the form of current produced by turbine generators such as in coal-fired and gas-fired power plants,         hydroelectric dams, and wind turbines.         The sinusoidal waveform of many AC sources occurs as a result of the current being generated from the rotation         of a magnetic field that induces a current in a nearby conductor first in one direction and then the other.\n        Alternating current is the dominant method of transporting electric power in [transmission network]s and         [distribution network]s, due in large part to the ability to easily step the voltage up and down using         [transformer]s to increase efficiency.         AC is the way power is delivered to homes and businesses, and is used for many high-power applications         including electric motors, pumps, compressors, incandescent and fluorescent lighting, and electric heating         with both resistance and induction.\n        Alternating current can be converted to direct current using a [rectifier].",
