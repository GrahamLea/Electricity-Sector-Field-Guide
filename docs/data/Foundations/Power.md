# Power
#UsedVeryFrequently

## Synonyms
- Electric Power


## Summary

A quantitative measure of the rate at which electrical [energy] is transferred.
Measured in watts ('W'), which is equivalent to one joule of energy per second.
Practical applications will often need to use kW or higher (MW or GW).

Power in electricity is literally the same as "power" in fundamental physics.
In electricity, it is the main way by which generators, other power sources, and [load]s are often measured,
e.g. a 700MW power station, a 10kW [solar PV] system, or a 10W LED light bulb.
It is also used for discussion of grid-wide properties like peak demand and generation capacity.

The relationship between power and energy is often described using the analogy of a water hose:
the <i>rate</i> at which water is coming out of the hose is analogous to power,
while the <i>amount</i> of water that is delivered over a given time period is analogous to energy.
As power is a rate of energy / time, multiplying a power measure by a time period gives the energy.
e.g. a motor run using a power of 0.4kW for 5 hours uses 2.0kWh of energy.

The power, [current], and [voltage] of an electrical circuit are all related by the equation
<i style='font-family: serif;'>P = VI</i>, where power (P) is the product of voltage (V) times current (I).
The power in an electrical system is not simply a function of the number of electrons moving, i.e. the current.
The same current can deliver varying amounts of power depending on the [voltage].

To connect power from large generators to consumers, voltage is typically "stepped up" -
and current stepped down proportionally - for long-distance transmission, and then vice versa before consumption.
The power remains constant along this journey (or would if not for losses due to inefficiencies).
Across a grid, the total power being used by loads and the power being generated needs to match very closely.

In [alternating current] (AC), both the current and voltage are sinusoidal waves, which means the power will
be as well.
Power figures given for AC circuits and components are typically root-mean-square (RMS) values over a time period
rather than an instantaneous measurement.
Some AC components cause AC voltage and current waves to shift apart, which results in a portion of the power
generated not being able to be used by loads to do work, and instead oscillating between the power source and
the loads as [reactive power].

Power measures may form a component of an electricity consumer's bill, but typically only if they are
incurring a charge based on their maximum power demand on the grid connection.
In many jurisdictions, this would be normal for commercial customers but not for residential.
Typically, though, the major element of electricity bills is for the energy consumed.
