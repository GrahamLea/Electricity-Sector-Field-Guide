# Current
#UsedVeryFrequently

## Synonyms
- Electric Current


## Summary

The flow of charged particles, e.g. electrons, through a medium, in response to a [voltage] being applied.
Conventionally represented by the symbol <i style='font-family: serif;'>I</i> (for <i>"intensité du courant"</i>).
Measured in [amperes], or “amps”, abbreviated as “A”.


## More

By way of analogy, measuring current in an electrical system is like measuring the volume of water passing a
point per second in a water system.
In electrical systems, current is most commonly electrons flowing through metals, known as an electron current.
In semiconductors, such as those used to create [transistors] and [solar PV], the charged particles forming
the current may include electrons, electron holes, and ions.

Current may exist in a system as [direct current], moving in one direction, or [alternating current], moving
back and forth.
By historical convention, the "direction of current" is the direction that positive charges would be flowing
if they were present, which is counter to the direction electrons will be flowing in electrical circuits, as
they are negatively charged.

Conductors and devices in an electrical system will have a maximum current they’re capable of withstanding.
[Resistors] can be used to reduce the current in a circuit.
[Fuses] and [circuit breakers] protect against excessive current by breaking the circuit.

The flow of electric current creates a magnetic field. When a current varies over time, it creates an
electromagnetic wave.
