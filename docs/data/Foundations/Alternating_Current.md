# Alternating Current
#UsedVeryFrequently

## Abbreviations
- AC


## Summary

A form of [current] where charged particles flow in both directions (in contrast to [direct current]),
with both voltage and current oscillating many times a second, typically in a sine-wave pattern.


## More

AC is the form of current produced by turbine generators such as in coal-fired and gas-fired power plants,
hydroelectric dams, and wind turbines.
The sinusoidal waveform of many AC sources occurs as a result of the current being generated from the rotation
of a magnetic field that induces a current in a nearby conductor first in one direction and then the other.

Alternating current is the dominant method of transporting electric power in [transmission network]s and
[distribution network]s, due in large part to the ability to easily step the voltage up and down using
[transformer]s to increase efficiency.
AC is the way power is delivered to homes and businesses, and is used for many high-power applications
including electric motors, pumps, compressors, incandescent and fluorescent lighting, and electric heating
with both resistance and induction.

Alternating current can be converted to direct current using a [rectifier].
