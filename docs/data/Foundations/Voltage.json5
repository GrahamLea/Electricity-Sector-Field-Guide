    summary: "        Simply, the potential for [energy] transfer within a system.         Technically, the difference in electrical potential between two points, per unit of charge.         Conventionally represented by the symbol <i style='font-family: serif;'>V</i> or sometimes          <i style='font-family: serif;'>\u0394V</i>. Measured in [Volts], abbreviated as \u201cV\u201d.          ",
    more: "        Voltage is defined as [energy] (in joules) per unit charge (coulomb).         It is the amount of potential work that could be performed by each charged particle.         Note this means the energy in a circuit is not determined solely by the [current] (the amount of charged         particles moving), but also by the voltage applied. \n                Voltage is often explained in terms of analogy, for example a bowling ball lifted off the ground, which has         potential energy.         The potential energy of the bowling ball is a function of its mass and the height of the ball.         Lifting the ball higher increases the potential \"work\" (or damage!) it can do when dropped, even though         its mass hasn't changed.         In the same way, voltage can be thought of as the \"height\" of charged particles, with those at a higher         voltage having more potential to do work when they move from a point of high potential a lower one. \n                Voltage can be present independent of an electric circuit or a current.         A battery that is not in a circuit still has a voltage across its two ends.         This is like a dam with its pipes closed: there is still a lot of potential for energy transfer despite there         being no water moving. \n                While sometimes referred to as the \"pushing force\", voltage is not really a force.         It is representative of the force that can be created.         Technically, it is not voltage that pushes energy around a circuit, but the electric field induced by applying         the voltage to a conductor.         ",
