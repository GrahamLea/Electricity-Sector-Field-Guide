# Joule

## Abbreviations
- J


## Summary

The SI unit of [energy].
Not used as frequently in the electricity sector as other measures for energy, such as [kilowatt-hour]s.


## More

A joule is a very small amount of energy, roughly equal to that in half of a single sugar crystal.
It's not uncommon to see very large multiples of joules used in practical applications, 
e.g. one person's annual gas consumption might be measured in gigajoules (GJ), 
and a country's using petajoules (PJ) or higher.

Practical definitions of one joule related to electricity include:
the energy required to produce one [watt] for one second;
and the work required to move an electric charge of one coulomb through one [volts] of [electric potential difference].
The technical definition is the amount of work done if an object is pushed with a force of one newton and moves
one metre during the push.
