        summary:
        "Electricity generation that converts sunlight directly into electrical power through the use of solar \
         cells, which use the photovoltaic effect to create a [direct current].",
        more:
        "Solar cells are typically made by connecting two layers of slightly different forms of silicon. \
        When photons hit the materials, electrons are dislodged from the atoms in one of the materials into the other, \
        and aren't able to easily move back in the other direction. \
        Electrical cables then provide a low-resistance path for the electrons to migrate back to the other side, which \
        leads them around a circuit, creating a direct current. \n\
        A cell is typically small, roughly 10cm x 10cm. Multiple cells are connected into a solar panel or \"module\". \
        A group of panels connected in [series] is known as a string, and will add together the voltages of the panels. \
        Multiple strings connected together, either in series or [parallel], are referred to as an array. \
        (Technically, a single string is also an array.) \
        When panels or strings are connected in parallel, the currents are added together rather than the voltage. \n\
        Solar PV produces direct current (DC), but many electrical systems are built around [alternating current] (AC), \
        so an [inverter] is typically used to convert the power from DC to AC before it is either used or transmitted. \n\
        The power produced by a solar PV system is variable on multiple time scales. \
        It will change over a year based on a property's angle towards the sun at midday throughout the earth's orbit, \
        over a day based on the property's exposure to the sun as the earth rotates through day and night, \
        and even on the time scale of minutes and seconds as clouds or nearby objects shade parts of the system \
        from the sun's photons. \n\
        While it's not uncommon to hear solar PV referred to as just \"solar\", it's worth keeping in mind that there \
        are various other uses of solar technology in the energy industry, for example [concentrated solar power] for \
        electricity generation via heat, and solar water heating."
